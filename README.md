## üöÄ **How It Actually Works**

### **üìã Step-by-Step Process:**

#### **üè† Creating a Meeting (Host):**

1. **Visit the Website**
   - Go to [https://adjustmeeting.netlify.app](https://adjustmeeting.netlify.app)
   - You'll see the clean, professional homepage

2. **Fill Out the Create Meeting Form:**
   - **Your Name**: Enter your name (e.g., "John Doe")
   - **Meeting Title**: Enter a descriptive title (e.g., "Team Standup")
   - **Room Code**: Enter a custom code OR click "Generate" for a random one
   - **Example**: Name: "Sarah", Title: "Project Review", Code: "PROJ2024"

3. **Create the Meeting**
   - Click the blue "Create Meeting" button
   - Your camera and microphone will activate (allow permissions)
   - You'll see yourself in a properly sized video tile (not full screen!)
   - The meeting is now live and ready for participants

4. **Share the Room Code**
   - Copy the room code from the header (click the copy icon)
   - Share it with participants via text, email, or messaging app
   - Participants will use this exact code to request to join

5. **Manage Join Requests (This is where the magic happens!)**
   - When someone wants to join, you'll see an **orange notification popup**
   - The notification shows the participant's name and request time
   - Click "Review" or the orange admission button in the header
   - You'll see a list of people waiting to join with their details
   - Click the green checkmark ‚úÖ to **admit** or red X ‚ùå to **reject**
   - **Admitted participants will immediately appear in your video grid!**

#### **üë• Joining a Meeting (Participant):**

1. **Get the Room Code**
   - The meeting host will share a room code with you
   - Example: "PROJ2024" or "ABC123"

2. **Visit the Website**
   - Go to [https://adjustmeeting.netlify.app](https://adjustmeeting.netlify.app)
   - Look for the "Join Meeting" section on the right

3. **Fill Out the Join Form:**
   - **Your Name**: Enter your name (this is what the host will see)
   - **Room Code**: Enter the exact code the host shared
   - **Example**: Name: "Mike", Code: "PROJ2024"

4. **Request to Join**
   - Click the green "Join Meeting" button
   - Your camera and microphone will activate
   - You'll see a "Requesting to join..." message

5. **Wait for Host Approval**
   - The host will see your join request with your name
   - Once the host clicks "Admit", you'll automatically enter the meeting
   - **You'll now see the host and any other participants in the video grid!**

#### **üéÆ During the Meeting:**

**For Everyone:**
- **üé§ Mute/Unmute**: Click the microphone button (gray = on, red = muted)

- **üñ•Ô∏è Screen Share**: Click the monitor icon to share your screen
- **üë• Participants**: Click the users button to see who's in the meeting
- **üìû Leave**: Click the red phone button to exit the meeting

**For Hosts Only:**
- **üëë Host Controls**: You'll see a crown icon indicating you're the host
- **üîî Admission Alerts**: Orange notifications when someone wants to join
- **‚úÖ Approve/Reject**: Full control over who can enter your meeting

## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **üåê Enhanced Signaling System**

AdjustMeeting uses a **multi-tier signaling approach** for maximum reliability:

1. **Firebase Realtime Database** (Primary)
   - Real-time messaging across devices and networks
   - Handles join requests, WebRTC offers/answers, and ICE candidates
   - Works globally with low latency

2. **BroadcastChannel API** (Same-origin fallback)
   - Instant communication between browser tabs/windows
   - Perfect for testing and same-device scenarios

3. **Enhanced localStorage** (Final fallback)
   - Persistent storage with improved synchronization
   - Ensures the app works even without internet connectivity

### **üîó WebRTC Implementation**

- **Peer-to-Peer Connections**: Direct video/audio streams between participants
- **Multiple STUN Servers**: Google's STUN servers for NAT traversal
- **ICE Candidate Exchange**: Robust connection establishment
- **Media Track Management**: Proper handling of audio/video streams
- **Screen Share Support**: Seamless screen sharing with layout adaptation

### **üì± Responsive Design**

- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for smartphones and tablets
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Video grid adjusts to screen size and participant count
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons and intuitive gestures
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux

## üéØ **Current Capabilities**

### **‚úÖ What Works Perfectly:**

1. **Same Device Testing**
   - Open multiple browser tabs
   - Create meeting in one tab, join from another
   - Full video/audio communication works

2. **Same Network Communication**
   - Multiple devices on the same WiFi network
   - Reliable signaling through Firebase
   - Real-time join requests and admissions

3. **Professional Features**

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Network Limitations:**

**Cross-Network Reality:**
For participants on different networks (different ISPs, mobile data, etc.), additional infrastructure is needed:

- **TURN Servers**: For NAT traversal in complex network environments
- **Dedicated Signaling Server**: WebSocket server for guaranteed real-time messaging
- **Backend Database**: For persistent room and user management

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Setup**

### **Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+ and npm
